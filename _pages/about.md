I am a final year electrical engineering undergraduate at IIT Delhi, interested in machine learning, neuroscience and speech. 

Currently, I am a research intern at the [Senseable Intelligence Group](https://sensein.group/) at MIT. I work with Professor Satrajit Ghosh on speech emotion recognition. I am also a research assistant at the [Complex Systems and Neural Dynamics Lab](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~gsaurabhr/) at IIT Delhi, where I work with Professor Saurabh Gandhi on neuron classification.

Previously, I was a research intern at Professor Martin Vetterliâ€™s lab ([AudioVisual Communications Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcav/)) at EPFL. My work was on audio room simulation.

My resume is available [here](https://satvik-dixit.github.io/files/CV.docx.pdf).
