We wanted to get a fine-grained classification of brain cells on the basis of a wide variety of features. We looked at the peak-channel waveforms of the units and used metrics such as amplitude, duration and spread for our classification. Since every unit fired at different times, we also used metrics based on firing patterns, such as the firing rate, interspike intervals and burst frequency.
