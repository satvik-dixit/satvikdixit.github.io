Classification of neurons based on electrophysiological features
Bachelor Thesis at Complex Systems and Neural Dynamics Lab, IIT Delhi <br>
Advisor: Professor Saurabh Gandhi

We are trying to get a fine-grained classification of brain cells on the basis of a wide variety of features such as
1. Peak-channel waveform based metrics like  amplitude, duration and spread
2. Firing pattern based metrics such as the firing rate, inter-spike intervals and burst frequency
