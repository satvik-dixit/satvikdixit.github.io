Adding Directivities to sources and microphones for audio room simulation
Research Internship at AudioVisual Communications Lab, EPFL
Advisor: Dr Robin Scheibler

Pyroomacoustics is a python package for audio room simulation. By adding functionality to describe directivities in the sources and microphones, we were able to significantly improve the accuracy of the Room Impulse Response (RIR) Simulations.
